# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To get started, you will need to install [Node.js][node.js].

Once you make your changes, make sure to run `npm test` to make sure nothing breaks, and `npm run format`
and `npm run lint` to check code quality. Finally, we do track built files in this project, so make
sure to run `npm run package` and commit the built files with the source files.
