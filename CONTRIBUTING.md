# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To get started, you will need to install [Node.js][node.js]
and [yarn].

Once you make your changes, make sure to run `yarn test` to make sure nothing breaks, and `yarn format`
and `yarn lint` to check code quality. Finally, we do track built files in this project, so make
sure to run `yarn build` and `yarn package` and commit the built files with the source files.
